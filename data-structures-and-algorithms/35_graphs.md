## About

- Each item is a node (or vertex), and connected by Edges
- great at showing links and connections between things (almost like roads, or how facebook shows friend connections)
- Trees and linked lists for example are graphs
- Directed graphs: Movement is not bidirectional and movement goes from node to node (ex. One-way street).
- Undirected graphs: Movement can go back and forth between nodes (ex. highway between 2 cities)
- Unweighted Graphs: Information is in just the node
- Weighted Graphs: Information in the node, and can be in the edges.
- Cyclic Graph: When the nodes connect in such a way that a loop is made
- Acyclic: Nodes and edges do not form any loops, and just end.
