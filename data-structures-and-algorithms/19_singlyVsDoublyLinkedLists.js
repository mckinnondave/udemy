// Single vs Double?

// Single: simple implementation, less memory, faster (less operations). Cannot be traversed backwards.Use if you have less memory and need fast insertion/deletion

// Double: Traversed front or back. Complex to implement. More memory. Good when memory is not a factor and great for searching.

// Mostly going to see singly in interview questions.
