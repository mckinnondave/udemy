## STACKS

- Can be built through arrays or linked lists

- Arrays - Easier to access from memory as items are right beside each other whereas linked lists they're not (scattered all over memory).
- Linked Lists - Dynamic memory - can keep adding to memory whereas arrays need to double up memory when space is exceeded


## QUEUES

- Can be built through arrays or linked lists  

- Never want to build with an array because once you remove the first element, you then have to shift every other element - O(n) operation time.
- Using linked list and removing the first element just removes the pointer and the head - O(1) operation time
