## C# vs .NET

- C# is a programming language
- .NET is a framework for building apps on Windows - Not limited to C#
- .NET framework consists of 2 components - CLR (Common Language runtime) and Class Library

- CLR is an application that sits in memory which translates IL Code (intermediate language) into Native Code for machine. This means you can write an application in C# and don't have to worry about if the code will translate over for different machines (so long as that machine also has CLR to run the application)
