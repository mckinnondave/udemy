- At high level, app is built through building blocks called classes
- Class: is a container with data (attributes) and methods (functions)
- Namespace: a container of related classes
- As namespace amounts grow, we need a way to partition an application => we use an Assembly (DLL or EXE) which is simply a container of related Namespaces
